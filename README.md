## About
ketcoin is a toy blockchain prototype implementing a post-quantum cryptosystem 
developed as a project to better understand the inner workings of blockchain 
systems, peer-to-peer communication and post-quantum cryptography.

This project authored by Louis Tremblay Thibault and distributed under the 
MIT license.

This code, as well as the AMSS library it holds, are in no way safe or 
secure to use as of right now.

For testing purposes, a node will be active from time to time at 
ketcoin.louistt.com:13337.

## Usage
One is free to download and play around with the code. To do so, you can do 
the following : 

`$ git clone https://github.com/tremblaythibaultl/ketcoin.git`  
`$ cd ketcoin`  
`$ go build`  
`$ ./src -l 13337 -t ketcoin.louistt.com:13337`


This last line is not guaranteed to work all the time (as I will not be 
maintaining a seed node) but you are free to start your own network is you wish to.
